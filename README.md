# CollectionViewTemplate
A file template that automates the setup of UICollectionView, including creating view controllers, collection view cells, and view models. This significantly reduces the repetitive work involved, streamlining the process and saving developers time.

## Summery
If you're still working with UIKit and haven’t transitioned to SwiftUI, it’s important to recognize a key aspect: by not utilizing collection views, your app might be missing out on one of UIKit’s most powerful tools for building dynamic, highly flexible interfaces.

Apple’s Definition of CollectionView:
A collection view manages an ordered set of content, such as the grid of photos in the Photos app, and presents it visually in a highly customizable way.

## How it works
First you should download the collectionView-template and then copy it to this path ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates. It is vitally important to restart Xcode so as use the template.
